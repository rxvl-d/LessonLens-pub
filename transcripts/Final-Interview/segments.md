P1-FI-L1: "Yes, of course I would use it because it combines all the advantages that Google offers and the search results - I had the feeling that these are also the search results I would have found on Google - combined with the advantages that I now have here, namely that I have these fields to look at metadata, get a brief summary of the website and I don't need to open multiple tabs."

P1-FI-L2: "However, from my point of view, this only applies to topics that are not too large. That means if I'm looking for a specific reaction or a specific experiment, then it works very well. As soon as I searched for a lesson plan or a whole series of lessons, I noticed that there simply isn't space to put everything in this summary."

P1-FI-L3: "No, not at all. With the summaries and additional information of the metadata, that's very pleasant. It could theoretically be even a bit more from my point of view for larger topics. That you can hide the diagram when you're not using it, I think that's good. Yes, I probably need to learn how to read it exactly or need instructions for it, but it didn't overwhelm me in any way."

P1-FI-L4: "I liked both quite a lot. The metadata as I have it here, I found very structured. So it was good that it's just categorized and I know roughly what to expect. I believe I used the metadata more because they were like an extra. I had the feeling the green boxes are almost similar to what I generally get as a summary, so it wasn't so different. And I think I perceived the red boxes maybe a bit more as additional information that I can use but don't have to."

P1-FI-L5: "Yes, in one task I clicked on something from DGUV, which is an accident insurance company. I would never have looked at it before because I would have thought okay, that's insurance and has relatively little to do with education or school and teaching. And through the summary that was there, I was surprised that it was so tailored to chemistry teaching and therefore clicked on it."

P1-FI-L6: "For other sites, for example Live Chemistry, I sometimes didn't need the summary because I know the site and really like working with it. So in summary, yes it influenced me sometimes to click on things I would never have considered before, and for other sites I chose the site without maybe needing to use the summary."

P1-FI-L7: "I haven't noticed that they were wrong. I always found that what you read, you also got on the website. It became difficult as mentioned with more comprehensive topics, that this summary can't be complete because the topics are so large. For example, sites that present lesson plans on a large topic - there the information would be more helpful like 'here you find various lesson plans' and the summary was sometimes just a bit too short."

P1-FI-L8: "Finding was easier for me than designing. So finding a detailed experiment was relatively easy because you could search very precisely. For design, you had to compile it from several pages, that worked too. I didn't notice a huge difference for myself."

P1-FI-L9: "At the beginning I had to get used to it a bit. Especially when the diagram was mentioned after the first interview round. After that I only started to really use it for my search and would say from questions 5 and 6 I had already gotten quite used to it and then also liked using it, consciously clicked on the metadata and tried to use it and it helped."

P2-FI-L1: "In some points yes, in some points less. So I don't know if this interface only retrieves pages that have to do with education, so with Educational - if that's the case, then of course I don't need the information that it's educational. That confused me more."

P2-FI-L2: "Otherwise, I found the categories good to get a view of non-commercial or others, that's good for me to see if I actually have access to everything here or not. And particularly helpful is always which groups are being addressed. So when I saw that it was Higher Education or University, that's always an indication for me - okay maybe the experiments are too demanding for school."

P2-FI-L3: "Worksheets, so worksheets, lab protocols, experiments in general, because you can say very well in the metadata for which educational level it is, for which audience it is, so is it for students, is it for teachers. You can say that very well."

P2-FI-L4: "What I haven't tried as much is for information gathering, so to bring myself up to date again, I simply haven't tried it for that. For lesson plans I didn't find so much, I would probably need to search more precisely. But I always had the feeling that for lesson plans you either have to be members on such a site or portal, have to have subscribed to the magazine, meaning pay money for it."

P2-FI-L5: "So, I would just scroll through and I see, like, most results are worksheets and then there's this question about what the learning goals are and I could see easily if it aligned for 7th/8th students."

P3-FI-L2: "I think I'm still looking first for the titles and the sources, and then I'm looking, so it's a third thing, so if I'm not sure, then it's helpful to look at those summaries."

P3-FI-L3: "In the metadata, I would like to see which topic from the core curriculum is addressed and maybe even which chemical concept from the core curriculum is addressed. So is it more substance-particle, is it more energy, is it more interactions. That would be interesting. Otherwise, educational level is very good and is it for teachers is it for students or is it for both."

P3-FI-L4: "And here I would find it very interesting with the diagram, if possible... Could be that everything here is directly educational, if you could maybe divide educational again, in case it's not educational. So something like Medicine comes up very often when I search for things in chemistry or chemistry topics, then medical sites come up very frequently. Or is it maybe only then specialist chemistry, so expert knowledge and not educational, so what's like research - those would be categories for me that might come in here to refine my search."

P3-FI-L5: "I found the pop-up thing a bit annoying, but I guess because of the associations, when I got more used to it, then it became a bit better. I think I ignored the visualization, it was more reading text, and I liked the summaries of the content of the pages, so that you know whether there is material available or not."

P3-FI-L6: "The questions about what specific experiments are included really helps me understand if it will work in my classroom"

P4-FI-L3: "I think I would use the summary of the content pages, I think that's quite useful."

P4-FI-L4: "They differed. I remember the law of the large numbers, it was really bad, I think, because it was mainly stating that it's about the law of the large numbers. But some were quite good. The ones that stated whether there is material available, and whether they have worked through examples - that was quite helpful."

P4-FI-L5: "It depended on the task. For instance, if I had to look at more complex content, or to find material for more complex content, I looked for some keywords. For the more demanding educational tasks, like finding materials for different student groups, I tried to look for keywords for teaching methods that I know are helpful."

P4-FI-L6: "For task four, I was mainly looking for games, so content related to the potential interests of the student. For the assessment, I had a source in mind."

P5-FI-L1: "I think for the summary information, it helped me to choose which result I wanted to inspect more."

P5-FI-L2: "I think related to educational requirements, because finding content is not that difficult, but finding content that fits particular requirements for particular student needs and teaching methods is harder. And I think for assessment purposes it could be useful as well if you don't have the source in mind."

P5-FI-L3: "For materials, it would be cool to see the teaching methods that are associated with it if possible. It's not always mentioned."

P6-FI-L1: "I had mixed feelings, particularly due to the time constraints which affected my experience. The circle feature was not useful as it was too complex in structure and not detailed enough in information. I was also unsure about the accuracy of the educational portal and non-commercial classifications."

P6-FI-L2: "The green box was helpful because it used a question-and-answer format that aligned with questions I would naturally ask when looking for teaching materials. While I wasn't always confident about the accuracy or detail level of information in the green boxes, and they weren't available for all search queries, I generally liked them."

P6-FI-L3: "The metadata information wasn't particularly useful in this context since I already knew I was looking for teaching materials. Almost everything I found was in the same categories, so there wasn't much differentiation. This feature might be more helpful in different contexts."

P6-FI-L4: "When searching, I evaluate results before clicking links. The question-and-answer format helped me identify relevant and irrelevant results. While it wasn't perfect since it was automatically generated, it was particularly helpful when looking for project ideas, which are typically difficult to find. I used the green boxes to help decide whether to click on links or not."

P6-FI-L5: "I wouldn't use the circle feature as I don't see its usefulness, especially since it can't be rotated. I would want to keep the green box feature and possibly the metadata. I'd like the ability to toggle these features on and off as needed. While the metadata wasn't particularly useful for teaching material searches due to my specific search terms, the green box's structured content information was valuable."

P6-FI-L6: "Although I did use it for the educational level. When I see it's mostly higher education resources, I know right away I need to change my search."

P7-FI-L1: "The circle feature negatively affected cognitive load. The other features required some adjustment time. Initially, I found the colors distracting - especially the red color, which demands immediate attention. The green was more acceptable. After getting used to it, the cognitive load wasn't significant because I understood what information to expect. Minimizing the red color would help reduce distraction."

P7-FI-L7: "The green boxes were generally more useful for all tasks because they focused on content. For standard school tasks, like finding worksheets, metadata wasn't necessary. However, for more unusual or research-oriented tasks, metadata could be more useful, especially when results might include non-school context materials."

P7-FI-L8: "It integrated quickly, though it needed some adjustment time. The question-and-answer format was particularly intuitive."

P8-FI-L9: "It didn't affect my confidence because I'm already experienced in evaluating internet resources. However, it could be helpful for students who are less confident in judging internet resources. For example, I already know that certain sources like 'study fix' aren't reliable, but students might benefit from this additional guidance."

P8-FI-L10: "The questions and answers had a lot of words. It could have been helpful but if it's already a difficult task like that one. Wait. The creative ideas to ... That one. I have to read a lot more and it takes more time."

P8-FI-L11: "Different categories in the metadata might be helpful, particularly indicators of whether sources are official or state-sponsored versus private sites or student paper collections. This would help with trust assessment."

P8-FI-L12: "The metadata information was distinctly different due to its list-like structure rather than paragraph format. The question-answer format was also unique and appreciated. Both extensions provided additional information, though the metadata's usefulness was limited in this specific search context. For research purposes with more diverse results, the metadata information might be more valuable."P4-FI-L1: The extension integrates well into my natural search process.

P9-FI-L1: I found myself just looking at the titles when there was too much to read in the summaries.

P9-FI-L2: I use Google every day to search for materials, which is my standard procedure to get information for my next lesson.

P9-FI-L3: The additional information from Google is always helpful and doesn't hurt in any way.

P9-FI-L4: When we look at the circle diagram, the cognitive load varies depending on which layers you're examining.

P9-FI-L5: The inner layers have a lower cognitive load compared to the outer layers where all information is available.

P9-FI-L6: The red boxes were really good because the tags and metadata were small.

P9-FI-L7: Once I've filtered down to worksheets for my grade level, the metadata all looks the same.

P9-FI-L9: Once I've got the keywords right, these green box information just tell me what I already know from looking at the results

P10-FI-L1: The green boxes containing questions and answers are longer, so they require more cognitive load.

P10-FI-L2: While it's more cognitive load than just using Google, you might save more time overall by using this approach.

P10-FI-L3: The specific content questions help me choose between similar worksheets.

P10-FI-L4: The circle diagram helps me find information about what kind of material is available on the page at the moment.

P10-FI-L10: For example, in my previous search, I could see there was a lot of higher education content, which I didn't need for my students.

P10-FI-L11: This allowed me to adjust my search accordingly.

P11-FI-L1: My evaluation process has two steps.

P11-FI-L3: First, I check if the results come from a resource I trust or have used before.

P11-FI-L4: Then, I examine the information from your boxes to see if they align with my task or search query.

P11-FI-L5: Sometimes, when there's nothing else available, I'll look at links from sources I don't know or trust.

P11-FI-L6: I often find this wastes my time as the materials aren't suitable for my needs.

P12-FI-L1: A key feature I'd like to see would be some sort of trust indicator, though I acknowledge this might be difficult to implement.

P12-FI-L8: For example, when dealing with chemistry tasks, I encountered materials that seemed to be created by students.

P12-FI-L9: While these students might be good at chemistry and capable of creating their own tasks, the material might not be suitable for teaching purposes.

P12-FI-L10: Having some way to identify trusted materials would be valuable.

P12-FI-L11: Life History is a good example of a trusted source.

P12-FI-L12: It would be helpful to have suggestions for updating search queries when the initial results aren't satisfactory.

P12-FI-L23: For example, if I search for "octet rule" and don't get the right information, the system could suggest using "noble gas configuration" instead.
